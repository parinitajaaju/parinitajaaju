                 Welcome to my Portfolio that I designed as part of the Introduction to Programming course. I hope you get to know a little bit about me, as well as some of the work I've done. I was homeschooled for a large part of my life, allowing me to delve more into art and other creatives that I was interested in. After which, I did my 10th, 11th, and 12th. I'm also an avid reader and writer, and I love to write short fictional stories. I've had experience with various digital software in the past, including Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, especially through my Mass Media studies in 12th grade, which exposed me to a range of digital skills.</p>
